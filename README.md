# socNetAPI

socNetAPI is model and controller for the backend of a social networking application. Building this application taught me about the inner workings of those apps and gave me a solid introduction to mongoose and mongoDB.

## Features

- **mongoDB storage:** Allows for scalable, document-based storage.

- **mongoose ODM:** Abstract db operations for faster deployments.

- **express.js:** Easily build middleware without writing a lot of js.
